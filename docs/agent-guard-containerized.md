## Overview

CyberArk's Agent Guard is an AI agent security tool supporting secure secret retrieval for agents managed via external secret providers such as AWS Secrets Manager and CyberArk Secrets Manager (previously CyberArk Conjur), Conjur Open Source, and traceability of AI agent MCP communications via the Agent Guard's MCP Proxy.

The tool uses the [Agent Guard CLI](../agent_guard_core/cli.md).

The Agent Guard Docker image is available from Amazon ECR, accessible through the AWS Marketplace.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- A working Docker setup
- AWS CLI installed and configured
- Access to the Agent Guard image through AWS Marketplace

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Configure AWS Authentication

Set up the following environment variables for AWS authentication in your CLI:

```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-aws-access-id"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-access-key"
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN="your-aws-token" 
export AWS_REGION="your-region"
```

### Step 2: Authenticate with Amazon ECR

Log in to AWS ECR to access the Agent Guard image repository:

```bash
aws ecr get-login-password --region <your-aws-region> | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 709825985650.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```

### Step 3: Pull and Set Up the Agent Guard Container

1. Pull the Agent Guard Docker image from Amazon ECR:
   ```
   docker pull 709825985650.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/cyberark/cyberark.agent-guard:v1.0.4
   ```

2. Tag the image locally for easier reference:
   ```
   docker tag 709825985650.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/cyberark/cyberark.agent-guard:v1.0.4 agc
   ```

You're now ready to use the Agent Guard container with the local tag `agc`.

## Audit and monitor with the MCP Proxy
CyberArk's Agent Guard MCP Proxy is an AI agent security tool built for developers and has full auditing and monitoring capabilities. Every interaction between the AI agent and your MCP servers is logged, providing complete traceability and compliance with enterprise security standards.

### 1. Enable the Agent Guard MCP Proxy in your existing configuration

Agent Guard offers an 'apply-config' command which automatically enables the Agent Guard MCP Proxy in your existing configuration.
You can also elect to make the changes manually, by prepending 'docker run agc' to your MCP server configuration block:
An example config of an MCP client which looks like this:
```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fetch": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-server-fetch"
      ],
      "transportType": "stdio"
    }
  }
}
```

turns into:

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fetch": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "agc",
        "mcp-proxy",
        "start",
        "-c",
        "audit",
        "uvx",
        "mcp-server-fetch
      ],
      "transportType": "stdio"
    }
  }
}
```

If you want to use the 'apply-config' command, locate the path of your MCP server configuration file (let's call it /home/user/mcpservers.json for the same of the example), and run the following command:

```
docker run -v /home/user/:/config agc mcp-proxy apply-config -c audit
```

Agent Guard will automatically scan the folder for any relevant JSON files and modify it to the Agent Guard MCP Proxy, and output the
modified configuration file.

### 2. Update the AI agent's MCP configuration

From the output, copy the audit capabilities that interest you into your AI agentâ€™s `<mcp-config>.json` file.

### 3. (Optional) Automate injecting secrets into environment variables
To provide secure credential management in the MCP servers, you can automate fetching the credentials from your credential provider or secrets manager, and injecting them as environment variables before starting the MCP server. For more details, see the [Agent Guard CLI](../agent_guard_core/cli.md).

For example

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fetch": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "agc",
        "mcp-proxy",
        "start",
        "-c",
        "audit",
        "--secret-uri",
        "conjur://my-api-key/MY_API_KEY",
        "--get-secrets-from-env",
        "uvx",
        "mcp-server-fetch
      ],
      "transportType": "stdio"
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Set up the log file

Logs are written to **agent_guard_core_proxy.log**, and is written under /logs insides the container. For you to see it,
make sure you mount the /logs directory. 

For example, this will cause the looks to be written to /tmp/agent_guard_core_proxy.log on the host:
```
docker run -v /tmp:/logs
```

### Example

Set up a configuration file, **config-sample.json**, locally in **/tmp/config**.

Run the following to apply the Agent Guard's audit capabilities to your config-sample file.

```
docker run -v /tmp/config:/config agc mcp-proxy apply-config -c audit
```

#### Output:
![apply-config](/docs/images/mcp-proxy-apply-config.png)


Copy over to your AI agent's MCP config file the activity you want to log. For example, `fetch` logs request and response activity between your AI agent and the MCP server you are working with:

![ai-agent-config](/docs/images/mcp-proxy-ai-agent-config.png)

### Log output
When you run your MCP host, you should start seeing the host interacting with the proxied MCP server querying it for the List operations like this:

![log](/docs/images/output.png)

As you interact with the server, you should see more logs:

![server-interaction-logs](/docs/images/output-server-interaction.png)

## Retrieve a secret

CyberArk's Agent Guard for Secret Retrieval (dockerized) is built for AI agent developers, and can be used to  streamline secret retrieval and reduce boilerplate. 

Make sure you have at least one secret stored in your Secrets Manager; for example: a secret named **secret1** with value **1234567890**.

Run the container to fetch the secret. For example, if you are using AWS Secrets Manager:

```
   export MY_SECRET=$(docker run \
     -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID \
     -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY \
     -e AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=$AWS_SESSION_TOKEN \
     -e AWS_REGION=$AWS_REGION \
     agc secrets get \
     -p aws-secretsmanager \
     -k secret1)
    
```

   You can now use $MY_SECRET in your scripts or application.
